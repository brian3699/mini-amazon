# Project Overview

A website where a user can register, purchase, and sell products. This project used Skeleton code created by [Rickard Stureborg](http://www.rickard.stureborg.com) and [Yihao Hu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yihaoh/).

I have created the Database schema and generated a sample database (using Python) with 2,000 users and 30,000 purchases that meet all the SQL constraints defined in the schema. Created a carts page where a user can submit an order, delete items from the cart, and save items for later. Also, created an order history page where the user can view previous purchases and order status.
